# Introduction

This Flask project is intended to serve as an advertisment for BU Jalwa.

The project is intended to be submitted as part of remediation project for WR152 at Boston University. The aspects of the website such as the layout and motivations/demotivations for joining the team were concluded using the results from the research paper "Understand the Motivations and Demotivations for Collegiate Competitive Dance" by Anurag Mathews (anuragm1@bu.edu).
